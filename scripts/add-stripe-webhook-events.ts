/**
 * Ops script: ensure the Stripe webhook endpoint for this app is subscribed
 * to every event the handlers depend on.
 *
 *   - setup_intent.succeeded        (green an ACSS/PAD guarantee once verified)
 *   - charge.dispute.created        (flag a chargeback, block the receipt)
 *   - charge.refund.updated         (revert a failed/canceled refund)
 *   - payment_intent.succeeded      (grant a premium-resource purchase)
 *   - payment_intent.payment_failed (record a declined purchase)
 *   - payment_intent.canceled       (record an abandoned purchase)
 *   - charge.refunded               (REVOKE premium access after a refund)
 *
 * The last four were dispatched by the webhook long before they were listed
 * here. Re-run this against LIVE whenever the handler list changes: refund
 * revoking access is only as good as charge.refunded actually being delivered.
 *
 * Operates in the mode of STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (live vs test). Idempotent:
 * merges the events into the endpoint's existing list (never removes any) and
 * is a no-op if they're already present (or the endpoint listens to "*").
 *
 * Usage: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=... npx tsx scripts/add-stripe-webhook-events.ts
